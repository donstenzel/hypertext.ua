- [/] optional args instead of fill value for tags
  Something like `Div Î±:{"class" "bubble"} {...}`
  - [x] functions
    `html.exp.ua` has these for now, not sure if I want to commit
    to this as the optional argument syntax may (probably?) change
  - [ ] move all pages to new style

- [ ] (optional) persistent logging to a file

- [x] headers in response
- [x] url encode

- [x] structure for a request:
  - method
  - path
  - query
  - fragment
  - headers
  - data
